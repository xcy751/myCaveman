A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill/plugin and Codex plugin that makes agent talk like caveman — cutting **~75% of output tokens** while keeping full technical accuracy. Plus a companion tool that compresses your memory files to cut **~45% of input tokens** every session.

Based on the viral observation that caveman-speak dramatically reduces LLM token usage without losing technical substance. So we made it a one-line install.

## Before / After

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🗣️ Normal Claude (69 tokens)

> "The reason your React component is re-rendering is likely because you're creating a new object reference on each render cycle. When you pass an inline object as a prop, React's shallow comparison sees it as a different object every time, which triggers a re-render. I'd recommend using useMemo to memoize the object."

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🪨 Caveman Claude (19 tokens)

> "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`."

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### 🗣️ Normal Claude

> "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. The issue you're experiencing is most likely caused by your authentication middleware not properly validating the token expiry. Let me take a look and suggest a fix."

</td>
<td>

### 🪨 Caveman Claude

> "Bug in auth middleware. Token expiry check use `<` not `<=`. Fix:"

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Same fix. 75% less word. Brain still big.**

**Sometimes too much caveman. Sometimes not enough:**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

#### 🪶 Lite

> "Your component re-renders because you create a new object reference each render. Inline object props fail shallow comparison every time. Wrap it in `useMemo`."

</td>
<td width="33%">

#### 🪨 Full

> "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`."

</td>
<td width="33%">

#### 🔥 Ultra

> "Inline obj prop → new ref → re-render. `useMemo`."

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Same answer. You pick how many word.**

## Benchmarks

Real token counts from the Claude API ([reproduce it yourself](benchmarks/)):

<!-- BENCHMARK-TABLE-START -->
| Task | Normal (tokens) | Caveman (tokens) | Saved |
|------|---------------:|----------------:|------:|
| Explain React re-render bug | 1180 | 159 | 87% |
| Fix auth middleware token expiry | 704 | 121 | 83% |
| Set up PostgreSQL connection pool | 2347 | 380 | 84% |
| Explain git rebase vs merge | 702 | 292 | 58% |
| Refactor callback to async/await | 387 | 301 | 22% |
| Architecture: microservices vs monolith | 446 | 310 | 30% |
| Review PR for security issues | 678 | 398 | 41% |

| Implement React error boundary | 3454 | 456 | 87% |
| **Average** | **1214** | **294** | **65%** |

*Range: 22%–87% savings across prompts.*
<!-- BENCHMARK-TABLE-END -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Caveman only affects output tokens — thinking/reasoning tokens are untouched. Caveman no make brain smaller. Caveman make *mouth* smaller. Biggest win is **readability and speed**, cost savings are a bonus.

### Science back caveman up

A March 2026 paper ["Brevity Constraints Reverse Performance Hierarchies in Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.00025) found that constraining large models to brief responses **improved accuracy by 26 percentage points** on certain benchmarks and completely reversed performance hierarchies. Verbose not always better. Sometimes less word = more correct.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman
```

`npx skills` supports 40+ agents — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and more. To install for a specific agent:

```bash
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -a cursor
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -a copilot
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -a cline
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -a windsurf
```

Or with Claude Code plugin system:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add JuliusBrussee/caveman
claude plugin install caveman@caveman
```

Codex:

1. Clone repo
2. Open Codex in repo
3. Run `/plugins`
4. Search `Caveman`
5. Install plugin

### Windows (VS Code Codex)

If you are using the VS Code Codex extension on Windows:

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Open the cloned repo in VS Code
3. Open Codex Settings → Plugins
4. Look under the repo/local marketplace for `Caveman`
5. Click `Install`
6. Run `Developer: Reload Window`
7. Verify `Caveman` appears under installed plugins

This repo includes a repo-local marketplace entry at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, so the plugin can be discovered directly from the cloned repository without adding personal machine-specific paths to the repo.

Install once. Use in all sessions after that.

One rock. That it.

## Usage

Trigger with:
- `/caveman` or Codex `$caveman`
- "talk like caveman"
- "caveman mode"
- "less tokens please"

Stop with: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

### Intensity Levels

Sometimes full caveman too much. Sometimes not enough. Now you pick:

| Level | Trigger | What it do |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Lite** | `/caveman lite` or `$caveman lite` | Drop filler, keep grammar. Professional but no fluff |
| **Full** | `/caveman full` or `$caveman full` | Default caveman. Drop articles, fragments, full grunt |
| **Ultra** | `/caveman ultra` or `$caveman ultra` | Maximum compression. Telegraphic. Abbreviate everything |

Level stick until you change it or session end.

## What Caveman Do

| Thing | Caveman Do? |
|-------|------------|
| English explanation | 🪨 Caveman smash filler words |
| Code blocks | ✍️ Write normal (caveman not stupid) |
| Technical terms | 🧠 Keep exact (polymorphism stay polymorphism) |
| Error messages | 📋 Quote exact |
| Git commits & PRs | ✍️ Write normal |
| Articles (a, an, the) | 💀 Gone |
| Pleasantries | 💀 "Sure I'd be happy to" is dead |
| Hedging | 💀 "It might be worth considering" extinct |

## Why

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOKENS SAVED          ████████ 75% │
│  TECHNICAL ACCURACY    ████████ 100%│
│  SPEED INCREASE        ████████ ~3x │
│  VIBES                 ████████ OOG │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Faster response** — less token to generate = speed go brrr
- **Easier to read** — no wall of text, just the answer
- **Same accuracy** — all technical info kept, only fluff removed ([science say so](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.00025))
- **Save money** — ~71% less output token = less cost
- **Fun** — every code review become comedy

## How It Work

Caveman not dumb. Caveman **efficient**.

Normal LLM waste token on:
- "I'd be happy to help you with that" (8 wasted tokens)
- "The reason this is happening is because" (7 wasted tokens)
- "I would recommend that you consider" (7 wasted tokens)
- "Sure, let me take a look at that for you" (10 wasted tokens)

Caveman say what need saying. Then stop.

## Caveman Compress

Caveman makes Claude *speak* with fewer tokens. **Caveman Compress** makes Claude *read* fewer tokens.

Your `CLAUDE.md` loads on **every session start**. A 1000-token project memory file costs you tokens every single time you open a project. Caveman Compress rewrites those files into caveman-speak so Claude reads less — without you losing the human-readable original.

```
/caveman-compress CLAUDE.md
```

```
CLAUDE.md          ← compressed (Claude reads this every session — fewer tokens)
CLAUDE.original.md ← human-readable backup (you read and edit this)
```

### How it works

A Python pipeline that shells out to `claude --print` for the actual compression, then validates the result locally — no tokens wasted on checking.

```
detect file type (local)  →  compress with Claude (1 call)  →  validate (local)
                                                                    ↓
                                                              if errors: targeted fix (1 call, cherry-pick only)
                                                                    ↓
                                                              retry up to 2×, restore original on failure
```

### What's preserved exactly

Code blocks, inline code, URLs, file paths, commands, headings, table structure, dates, version numbers — anything technical passes through untouched. Only natural language prose gets compressed.

### Compress benchmarks

| File | Original | Compressed | Saved |
|------|----------:|----------:|------:|
| `claude-md-preferences.md` | 706 | 285 | **59.6%** |
| `project-notes.md` | 1145 | 535 | **53.3%** |
| `claude-md-project.md` | 1122 | 687 | **38.8%** |
| `todo-list.md` | 627 | 388 | **38.1%** |
| `mixed-with-code.md` | 888 | 574 | **35.4%** |
| **Average** | **898** | **494** | **45%** |

### Full-circle token savings

| Tool | What it cuts | Savings |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **caveman** | Output tokens (Claude's responses) | ~65% |
| **caveman-compress** | Input tokens (memory files loaded per session) | ~45% |
| **Both together** | The whole conversation | Output + input both shrunk |

See the full [caveman-compress README](caveman-compress/README.md) for install, usage, and validation details.
